I always like song Reflection from Mulan.

Who is that girl I see\
Staring straight back at me?\
When will my reflection show\
Who I am inside?

I am lucky to work in a field that so many changes are happening, from data warehouse to data lake to lake house, from monolithic to decentralized data mesh, from on premise to cloud.
